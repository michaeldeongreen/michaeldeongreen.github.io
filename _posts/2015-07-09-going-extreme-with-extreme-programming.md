Hey there!  
  
I recently just gave a talk at [Architecting Innovation](http://architectinginnovation.com/) about going extreme with Extreme Programming. I have uploaded the slides on my blog. Feel free to look over the slides and share them with others. You can find the slides [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaeldeongreen/michaeldeongreen.github.io/master/static/attachments/Going-Extreme-with-Extreme-Programming.pptx).
