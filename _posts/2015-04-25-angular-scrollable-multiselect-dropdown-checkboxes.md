The application that I am currently working on required the use of a scrollable multiselect dropdown that contained checkboxes. We are using Angular.js on this particular project and after doing some research, I was able to find an example that was close to what I needed but needed slight modifications.  
  
[Here is the full example on jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/michaeldeongreen/jab4raoq/25/ "jsfiddle")  
  
**Update:** A co-worker showed me dotansimha's AngularJs Dropdown Multiselect Directive, which you can find [here](http://dotansimha.github.io/angularjs-dropdown-multiselect/#/ "angularjs dropdown multiselect").
