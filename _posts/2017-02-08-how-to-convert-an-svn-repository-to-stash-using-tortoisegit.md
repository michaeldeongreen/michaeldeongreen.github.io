Hi there!  
  
In this blog post, I will be demonstrating how to convert an SVN Repository to Stash using TortoiseGit with all of your SVN commit history.  
  
**Caveat**  
  
There are many ways to convert an SVN repository to a Stash repository, the following is a tutorial for how I recently converted a project hosted in SVN to a Stash repository. The developer who worked on this project before me had already put roughly the last 100 commits into Stash. However, this person left the project before I joined and I was not able to do any knowledge transfer.  
  
I continued to use SVN until I had time to learn how to convert the SVN repository to Stash and understand what changes needed to be made in the projectâ€™s TeamCity configurations to start using Git.  
  
Also, this tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of SVN and Stash.  
  
**What do you need?**  
  
* [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/download/) - TortoiseGit will be used to convert your SVN branch to a Stash branch.
* **SVN Repository Access** - You will need the SVN branch url and permission to access the SVN branch that you would like to convert to Stash.
* **Stash Repository Access** - The new remote Stash repository for your new project needs to have already been created or you need to have permission to be able to create a new repository.

**Step By Step!**  
  
**Step 1.** Create the new Stash repository. The sample repository name that I will be using is greensharesthoughts.tutorial  
  
**Step 2.** Once the repository has been created in Stash, clone the new Stash repository in a temporary directory. You are doing this because you want to get the settings in the local .git/config file.  
  
**Step 3.** Once the Stash repository has been cloned, inside of the cloned directory, Right-click on the mouse and select TortoiseGit then select Settings and choose _Edit local .git/config file_ and copy the settings to a text editor such as Notepad++ for future reference.  
  
**Step 4.** Navigate to the directory where your permanent Stash repository will be stored. Inside of this directory, Right-click and select Git Clone. On the clone screen:  
  
1. Enter the SVN Repository URL of the branch you want as your master. Example: _<http://svn.greensharesthoughts.com/svn/tutorials/branches/prod>_
2. Enter the Directory. Example: _C:\\stash\\greensharesthoughts.tutorial_
3. Next, select the From SVN Repository checkbox and uncheck every checkbox below this option
4. Press OK and allow TortoiseGit to convert the SVN Repository to a Stash Repository, this will take a while, depending upon the size of your SVN branch

**Step 5.** Once the conversion is complete, you should see your repository files. Inside of the repository root directory (_in my case, C:\\stash\\greensharesthoughts.tutorial_), you will want to Right-click , select TortoiseGit, select Settings and select Edit local .git/config and overwrite the settings with the Git settings that you copied from the temporary Stash directory you downloaded earlier and save these changes (_Step 3_).  
  
**Step 6.** As you Right-click, you will notice that there are SVN options on the context menu for TortoiseGit. To remove this, you will want to navigate to the root directory (in my case, _C:\\stash\\greensharesthoughts.tutorial_) and inside of this directory, find the .git folder (you may have to allow hidden folders to be seen in your Windows settings). Inside of this folder, there should be a folder called svn. Delete the svn file and the SVN options should be removed from your TortoiseGit context menu.  
  
**Step 7.** Next, using TortoiseGit, you will want to do a pull (if there is code in the remote repository, which was the case for me) and fix any merge issues.  
  
**Step 8.** Once all merge issues are fixed (if any), using TortoiseGit, you will want to do a commit and then push to the remote Stash repository and you have now converted your SVN repository to a Stash Repository with all of your SVN commit history.  
  
**Final Thoughts!**  
  
The project that I worked on had a very small codebase and I was the only developer on the project. If the project had been larger, I would have probably waited until the last push to Production occurred. I would then suspend all development (probably over the weekend) and merge all relevant branches into my SVN pristine/prod branch, so all needed changes are in one branch. Next, I would perform all of the steps mentioned in this tutorial and once the SVN repository has been converted to Stash (master), I would then start re-creating the branch structure I used in SVN ie Development, QA, Pre-Prod, Prod etc etc and then development would continue.
