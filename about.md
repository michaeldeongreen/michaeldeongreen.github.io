Well, a little about me. My name is Michael D. Green and I am a native Texan and a graduate of The University of Texas at Arlington.

Some of my hobbies include reading books in the self-help, epic fantasy, history and technical genre. I am a huge fan of George R.R. Martin, Les Brown and the Civil Rights Era. I'm also a sucker for a good television drama, be it American, English, Danish, Japanese or South Korean. I am also huge Japanese Anime fan and I read the manga One Piece regularly.

I tend to be passionate about technology, in particular software design, software development practices and how technology can be used to benefit everyone.

Last but not least, I make my living as an IT Consultant, Software Architect, SCRUM Master and Technology Evangelist and the opinions I express on my blog are my own and not the views of my employer.
